The first wave was the nationalist wave and led to Gandhian experiments in education including Nai Talim.
The architecture of DA-IICT is functional, but what surrounds it is a fascinating garden.
The landscape was planned and developed in a manner that no rainwater is lost.
The campus is a haven for bird-watchers, with a variety of species of birds being spotted.
DA-IICT is spread over 50 acres of land in Gandhinagar, Capital City of Gujarat.
The entire design is oriented towards preserving the environment.
On 30 November 2004, the DA-IICT was included in the list of Universities maintained by the University Grants Commission under Section 2(f) of the UGC Act, 1956. (Link)
The National Assessment and Accreditation Council, Government of India has accredited DA-IICT with an 'A' Grade in 2017.
